# Overview

This is a full-stack web application consisting of a client-side React application and a server-side Express application. It allows users to submit contact information through a form, which is then saved in a PostgreSQL database. The application provides company contact information through an API and also a thankyou page. I decided to use Tailwind UI for the frontend to make the design process quicker and allow more focus on the API development.
